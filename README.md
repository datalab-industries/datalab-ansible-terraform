This repository contains tools and rules for automatically deploying datalab instances using Terraform/OpenTofu and Ansible.
It can be used as a template for deploying your own datalab instance, and optionally periodically resynced on new releases.

Use of Terraform for cloud provisioning is OPTIONAL; the Ansible playbooks are sufficient to set up a datalab instance on a existing hardware.
The Ansible playbooks can even be used to deploy datalab on shared hardware; all mandatory services will be deployed within containers, so it is possible to set up the full NGINX + datalab stack alongside an existing reverse proxy managing other services, although this will need to be configured by the user.

Ideally, various aspects of the configuration will be transferrable, and thus only instance-specific configuration will need to be provided (e.g., usernames, domain names), in which case your instance version of this repository can be kept fairly in-sync with the main branch (which will continue to be updated as datalab's requirements grow and change).

Attempts will be made to tabulate the supported versions of datalab with each release of from this repository.

## Supported versions

| This repository version | *datalab* version |
|---|---|
| v0.1.x | v0.4.x  |
| v0.2.x | v0.4.x  |
| v0.3.x | v0.5.x+ |


## Overview

### Cloud provisioning with Terraform/OpenTofu

The `./terraform` directory contains Terraform/OpenTofu plans for provisioning cloud hardware (VMs, storage etc.) for use with datalab.

Implemented providers:

- Azure

Planned providers:

- OpenStack
- Hetzner

### Infrastructure automation with Ansible

The `./ansible` directory contains Ansible "playbooks" for taking a fresh VM and installing, configuring, launching, re-launching and managing datalab and NGINX containers.

Stack:

- NGINX
- Docker Compose for API, app and database containers
- Simple filesystem for filestore

### Datalab versioning

The Ansible playbooks will deploy the datalab version that is included as a `git
submodule` to this repository.
It is highly recommended to only run the Ansible playbook from a clean
repository state (i.e., no uncommited changes) to ensure reproducibility.

## Usage

### Ansible automation

#### First-time setup

These instructions assume you have prepared the server on which you would like
to deploy *datalab*, and that it is:

- accessible via SSH (using your local SSH config),
- running Ubuntu 22.04 or a similar distro with `apt` available.

It also assumes you have set up Ansible on your local machine.
You can find instructions for this in the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/get_started_ansible.html).

The first step is to clone this repository (or your fork) with submodules:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:datalab-org/datalab-ansible-terraform
```

You can then navigate to the to the `./ansible` directory to begin configuring
your deployment.

There are two main sources of configuration:

1. The Ansible inventory, which tells Ansible which hosts to deloy to,
2. *datalab* configuration files.

To create the Ansible inventory ([full
documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html)), you need to edit the YML file
called `inventory.yml` in the `./ansible` directory:

```yaml
ungrouped:
  hosts:
    <hostname>:
      ansible_become_method: sudo
      ansible_user: <remote_username>
      api_url: <desired_datalab_api_url>
      app_url: <desired_datalab_app_url>
      # Additional optional settings:
      mount_data_disk: <disk device file location, e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/sdb or otherwise or a full fstab configuration, e.g., `UUID=aaaa-bbbb-ccc>
      data_disk_type: <the fstype of the data disk, defaults to 'xfs'
      borg_encryption_passphrase: <the passphrase for the borg encryption>
      borg_remote_path: <the command to run borg on the repository (e.g., borg1 vs borg2)>
      borg_repository: <the path to the borg repository, either local or remote>
```

where `<hostname>` and the various setting should be configured with your chosen
values.

Next, we can edit the config files in the `./vaults/datalab` directory.
See the [online documentation](https://the-datalab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/) for an
explanation of each of the settings.
These files contain the desired *datalab* settings:

1. `./vaults/datalab/prod_config.json`: the *datalab* Python config file.
2. `./vaults/datalab/.env_server`: the secrets required by the server as an env
   file (e.g., keys to external integration with GitHub, ORCID).
3. `./vaults/datalab/.env`: any variables required by the web app.
4. `./vaults/datalab/.ssh` (OPTIONAL): any SSH keys and config required to be mounted into the server container. These files should each be individually encrypted.
5. `./vaults/borg/.ssh` (OPTIONAL): any SSH keys or known hosts required to configure the borg backup system. These files should be individually encrypted.

It is recommended that you version control these files **with encryption** and commit it to your
fork.
To encrypt them, you can run

```shell
ansible-vault encrypt inventory.yml vaults/datalab/prod_config.json vaults/datalab/.env vaults/datalab/.env_server vaults/datalab/.ssh/* vaults/borg/.ssh/*
```

and provide a password when prompted (which will then need to be kept safe and
used every time the Ansible playbook is run). Omit the optional SSH wildcards if no
SSH keys are required.
You should never commit these files directly without encryption.

Once all these configuration steps have been performed, we can try to execute
the Ansible "playbook" that will install all the pre-requisite services, build
the Docker containers as configured, connect them via Nginx and add hardening
services such as fail2ban to the server.

This is achieved by running:

```shell
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```

If completed successfully, the server should now be running a *datalab*
instance at your configured URL!

If you are using your own domain, you will need to update your DNS settings so that your domain name points to the IP of the server as given in your inventory file.

#### Keeping things up to date

To update the *datalab* version, you simply update the git submodule in
`src/datalab`. This can be pinned to your fork and accomodate any custom changes
you desire (though you may also need to test and maintain your own set of
ansible rules and configuration for this).

Once you have chosen the *datalab* version, it can be redployed with `make
deploy` or

```shell
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -i inventory.yml playbook.yml --tags deploy
```

To update the ansible playbooks themselves with any changes from the upstream
repository, you can similarly maintain the submodule in
`src/datalab-ansible-terraform` and either manually sync changes across, or use
the helper script:

```shell
./sync-ansible-upstream.sh
```

which will copy just the changed playbooks across, and commit them. You should
be careful to review these changes before committing them to your fork,
especially if you have made any custom changes to the playbooks.
Be sure to also commit the changes to your submodule so you know precisely which versions
of the playbooks are running.

### Cloud provisioning

These instructions will use OpenTofu, an open source fork of Terraform.
You should install OpenTofu for your local machine by following the instructions in the [OpenTofu docs](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/).
OpenTofu will let you authenticate your local machine with your cloud provider (with provider-specific instructions) and perform the kind of operations you would normally have to do in your cloud providers' dashboard.
Here, we use it to simply provision a Linux VM (of configurable size) and associated storage.

After installing OpenTofu, the first step is to run, from the base of this repository:

```shell
tofu -chdir=terraform init
```

This will initialise your local machine and guide you through any additional
steps (such as installing cloud provider APIs, authenticating against them, etc.).

The next step is to adjust any of the variables in `./terraform/azure/variables.tf` for your deployment, for example, the desired location of VMs, the usernames for any local accounts to be created on the VM.

As of writing, only Azure is supported as a cloud provider, but in the future we will aim to abstract these variables somewhat to enable other providers.
As such, you will need to have the [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/](Azure CLI) installed locally (and logged in, via `az login`).

The next step is to generate plan of your infrastructure, without actually
provisioninig the hardware.
This can be achieved with

```shell
tofu -chdir=terraform/azure plan -out main.tfplan
```

To now request the resources from the provider and initialise any VMs, we apply
the plan with:

```shell
tofu -chdir=terraform/azure apply main.tfplan
```

> [!WARNING]
> ðŸš¨ This will start the billing process with your cloud provider! ðŸš¨

Providing that the variables for the given cloud provider have been set correctly, this should launch a VM that has the correct SSH and networking config ready for datalab.
For example, using the Azure provider, you should now be able to locally query your instance with the `az` CLI, using info provided by OpenTofu.

```shell
resource_group_name=$(tofu -chdir=terraform/azure output -raw resource_group_name)
az vm list --resource-group $resource_group_name --query "[].{\"VM Name\":name}" -o table
```

You can destroy running resources by first, naturally, plotting their destruction:

```shell
tofu -chdir=terraform/azure plan -destroy -out main.destroy.tfplan
```

then applying it

```shell
tofu -chdir=terraform/azure apply main.destroy.tfplan
```

This will also destroy attached storage (rarely desirable), so care must be taken when executing this plan.
